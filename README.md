# CodeYou-Capstone-2024

**Project Overview**
E-commerce is the it-girl right now and it looks like she’s here to stay. 

Whether you are a seller, a buyer, both, an observer or just an accountant, you’ve probably noticed that each year, fewer and fewer people are shopping in brick and mortar stores. 

Before I continue, let’s make sure that we’re on the same page about how we define e-commerce. First, we start by the definition of commerce which is the activity of buying and selling products, especially on a large scale. Simply put, commerce is the exchange of goods or services among two or more parties.

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) refers to companies and individuals that buy and sell goods and services over the internet and it has transformed the way we live, specifically the way people shop and consume products and services worldwide. 

However, this “transformation” doesn’t look the same globally. The rate of adoption - of selling things online and/or buying things online - is happening and spreading faster in some regions and countries than others. My project explores this further by: 
Establishing an understanding of what e-commerce looks like globally (by region and countries)
Zooms in to analyze what this looks like specifically in Sub-Saharan African countries 
Highlights and compares trends against the global picture
